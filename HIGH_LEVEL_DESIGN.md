# High-Level Design: Secure Microservices Deployment Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a secure, scalable microservices deployment pipeline, showcasing modern DevSecOps practices.

## Core Components

1. **Microservice Application**
   - Containerized Node.js application
   - Deployed as Kubernetes pods

2. **Version Control and CI/CD**
   - GitHub for version control
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
     - Builds Docker images
     - Runs security scans
     - Pushes images to container registry

3. **Container Orchestration**
   - Amazon EKS for Kubernetes cluster
   - Manages deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers

4. **GitOps**
   - ArgoCD for declarative, Git-centric delivery
   - Ensures consistency between Git repository and live cluster state

5. **Security**
   - Trivy for vulnerability scanning of Docker images
   - Kubernetes Network Policies for inter-pod communication control

6. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Grafana for metrics visualization and dashboards

## Data Flow

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions triggered:
   - Builds Docker image
   - Runs Trivy scan
   - Pushes image to container registry
3. ArgoCD detects changes in Git repository
4. ArgoCD syncs changes to EKS cluster
5. Application pods updated in EKS
6. Prometheus continually scrapes metrics
7. Grafana displays metrics in dashboards

## Security Measures

- Least privilege principle in EKS and GitHub Actions
- Regular vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Network isolation with Kubernetes Network Policies
- Continuous monitoring for anomalies

## Scalability and Reliability

- EKS provides scalable, managed Kubernetes
- Microservices architecture allows independent scaling
- GitOps ensures reliability and reproducibility of deployments
