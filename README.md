# Secure Microservices Deployment Pipeline

This project demonstrates a secure, scalable microservices deployment pipeline using modern DevSecOps practices.

## Features

- Containerized microservice application
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions
- Kubernetes deployment on Amazon EKS
- GitOps with ArgoCD
- Security scanning with Trivy
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Network policies for enhanced security

## Architecture

The project uses a microservices architecture deployed on Amazon EKS. It incorporates:

- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- ArgoCD for GitOps-based deployments
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
- Trivy for vulnerability scanning

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up an Amazon EKS cluster
3. Install ArgoCD in your cluster
4. Configure GitHub Actions secrets
5. Push changes to trigger the pipeline

## Monitoring

The project uses Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. Custom dashboards are available for monitoring the sample application.

## Security

Security is a key focus, with:
- Trivy scanning in the CI pipeline
- Network policies in Kubernetes
- Secure configurations for all components

## Future Enhancements

- Implement ELK stack for logging
- Add more microservices
- Implement service mesh with Istio
